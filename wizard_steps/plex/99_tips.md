## 🎞 {{ _("Get the best quality") }}

{{ _("Plex sometimes defaults to low quality or shows its own adverts first. "
      "Here’s how to fix that:") }}

1. **{{ _("Disable trailers & extras") }}** – Settings → Experience → untick *Show cinematic trailers*  
2. **{{ _("Force original quality") }}** – Settings → Playback → set *Automatic* to *Original*  
3. **{{ _("Use a wired connection") }}** if you’re on a smart-TV for stutter-free 4K.

*Happy viewing!* 🍿
