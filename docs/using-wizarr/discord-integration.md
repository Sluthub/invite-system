# Discord Integration

#### Find your Discord Server ID

1. In Discord, go to your **Server Settings**
2. Select the **Engagement** tab
3. Enable Server Widget
4. Choose an Invite Channel (`general` for example)
5. Copy your **Server ID**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why not use an invitation link?**

Enabling the widget and the invite channel makes the Discord API dynamically generate an invitation link for the purpose of the widget.

This means that to use this integration, you don't need to generate a Never expiring invitation, which some users might want to avoid.
{% endhint %}
