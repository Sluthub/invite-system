Wizarr is an automatic user invitation system for Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby.  
Create a unique invite link and share it with users ‚Äî they‚Äôll be automatically added to your media server and guided through downloading apps, accessing request systems, and more!

**The problem**: Inviting your Friends/Family to your Plex server Is complicated and tedious. It's also a hard concept for them to get their head around.

**The solution**: Wizarr makes it easy to invite users to your server by simply sending them a link, and guides them through the process of getting set up.

<p>Since I work full-time on open-source projects spread across my organizations, my only source of income is donations from people like you that use & appreciate my stuff. So, if you can spare a dollar or two, I would really appreciate that. All the money goes towards paying rent, essentials like food, drinks etc, and most importantly it will be used to fuel my cookie addictionüç™<br></p>
